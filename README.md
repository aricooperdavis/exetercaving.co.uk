# University of Exeter Caving Club (UoESS)
> Probably the best Caving Club in the world...

---

Weâ€™re a friendly bunch of students at the University of Exeter who just like to explore, be that exploring the limit of fun that a person can safely sustain at our weekly socials, or exploring deep untouched caves across the world.

Come along on a taster trip during Fresher's Week to one of our favourite local caves - Pridhamsleigh Cavern! We'll provide transport, a guide, and all the gear you'll need to have a fantastic adventure.

> As a University caving club weâ€™re aimed at novices, so you donâ€™t need to have any kit or experience to join us. Our membership fees are very low, and we subsidise all of our trips, so our day trips and weekends away won't break the bank.

So come along and meet us, and I hope we can show you why we love what we do ðŸ™‚
